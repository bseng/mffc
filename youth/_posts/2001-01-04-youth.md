青年關係事工簡介 
================

Why MFFC needs to be involved in the Youth Relationship Ministry (YRM)

A lot of the marriage breakdowns can be prevented through providing
education on how to handle love relationships when young Christians are
still in their dating stage, MFFC YRM is one of the right channels for
youths to learn the correct and Biblical perspective of love, marriage,
and family.

There is no existing Chinese Christian association in Australia has
established a formal ministry focusing on youth relationships to fulfil
the need of this rapid growing Chinese young Christians here. Therefore,
it is a burden for us to establish a YRM for those young Christians who
need the relevant information, advice, service and support.
　
「家新」青年關係事工異象Vision of the Youth Relationship Ministry
-----------------------------------------------------------------
培育和教導澳洲華人青年基督徒，在與他人建立關係時，能榮神益人。
We are inspired by God to respond to the needs of the youths to build
relationship with their dates. We have prayed and defined our YRM vision
as: To guide and nurture Chinese young Christians in Australia, to
enable them to maintain and strengthen their relationship with one
another, so that they may be good testimony for Christ. 

目標Mission of the Youth Relationship Ministry
----------------------------------------------
藉著聖經真理和教導，去支持華人青年基督徒，去建立一個正確感情關係，為將來婚姻關係建立一個堅固根基。

In accordance to the teaching of the Bible, we seek to prepare and
support Chinese young Christians to build a right attitude towards
relationship and to maintain a healthy relationship with their dates
before marriage. 
　

Introduction of YRM
-------------------
YRM Committee has been set up since 2003. During 2004 - 2011, we
conducted a number of workshops (more than 30) for various Youth
Fellowships in different churches in Sydney. Topics include Dating,
Rejection and Sex and others. On average, more than 40 young people
attended in each workshop. This provides proof that there is a perceived
and recognized need for similar programs amongst the young Christians.
